## Use the following guidelines when developing your project:

*   Logic must be written in Python. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to enhance the look and feel of the cookbook.

*   Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
The website must be data-driven and can rely on structured data, unstructured data or a mix of structured and unstructured data. 

*   CRUD operations can be carried out using either SQL (e.g. MySQL/SQLite/Postgres) or NoSQL (e.g. MongoDB).

*   Use Flask, a micro-framework, to run your application. Provide instructions on how to run your project locally in your README.

*   Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the site on different screen sizes and browsers.

*   Share details of how you created your database schema in your README. Consider sharing working drafts or finalised versions of your database schema in a 'Database Schema' folder in your repo. Provide a link to this folder in your README.

*   We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.

*   The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.

*   Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. If some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.

*   Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.

*   Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as Heroku.
Non-requirements for this project:

*   Secure user authentication (e.g. via passwords) is not required for this particular project. Having each user just choose a username is sufficient. Secure authentication will be introduced in the Django module.

PLAGIARISM
It is each student’s responsibility to ensure that when they include (directly or indirectly) the work of others that this contribution is fully and adequately acknowledged and documented.

You are encouraged to ask your mentor/tutor for advice about your project work, but note that your project code should not include any code written by others unless it is explicitly credited to them with a comment above. Any such code provided by your mentor/tutor would not contribute to your assessment. Failure to attribute credit to code that isn’t yours will be considered as plagiarism and will result in a failing grade.
