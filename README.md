## 1. Project Goals

This project is all about facing a new, more difficult challenge which demonstrates Python as the backbone programming language which uses a NoSQL database, called MongoDB for managing all of the site user data.

The project needs to be able to demonstrate the use of CRUD functions:

    1. Create something
    2. Read something
    3. Update something
    4. Delete a something

The application is designed to be hosted on Heroku and will facilitate multiple end users simultaneously to manage their work related information on the site.  Users will be able to use the site by registering their names and then building their profile within the application.

The user's profile will let them select the medical facility at which they work.  They will then be able to select the department in which they work. They will then be able to see information about their department and edit the services offered by that department or add a new service in that department.

The user must then be able to the see the other departments at the medical facility.  They must be able to schedule an appointment for a service, offered by another department.  They must be able to mark the appointment a priority or not as well as favourite the department.  A favourites list of the departments must be available from their own profile.  They user must be able to unfavourite a department as well as to cancel or amend an appointment scheduled.

A nice to have, which is still being concidered for the design, will be to let the user rate a consultation by giving it stars out of 5.
